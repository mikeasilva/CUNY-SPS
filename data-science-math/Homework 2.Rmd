$$P(g|m) = \frac{52}{141} \approx 0.3688$$
```{r}
52/141
```

#### Step 2. 

If 102 of the applicants have graduate degrees, what is the probability that a randomly chosen applicant is male, given that the applicant has a graduate degree? Enter your answer as a fraction or a decimal rounded to four decimal places.
