Please find kNN.R

This R script requires a dataset, labelcol and K (number of nearest neighbors to be considered)

The dataset MUST Be numeric, except the labelcol
The labelcol must be the last column in the data.frame
All the other columns must be before the labelcol

To DO:

Please find icu.csv 
The formula to fit is "STA ~ TYP + COMA + AGE + INF"

Read the icu.csv subset it with these 5 features in the formula and STA is the labelcol.

Split the icu 70/30 train/test and
run the kNN.R for K=(3,5,7,15,25,50)

submit the result confusionMatrix, Accuracy for each K

Plot Accuracy vs K.

write a short summary of your findings.
