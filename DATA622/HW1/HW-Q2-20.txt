You just recently joined a datascience team.

There are two datasets junk1.txt and junk2.csv
They have two options
1. They can go back to the client and ask for more data
to remedy problems with the data.
2. They can accept the data and undertake a major analytics exercise.

The team is relying on your dsc skills to determine how they
should proceed.

Can you explore the data and recommend actions for each file
enumerating the reasons.
