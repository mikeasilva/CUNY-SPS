You have been hired by a local electronics retailer and the above dataset has been
given to you.
Manager Bayes Jr.9th wants to create a spreadsheet to predict is a customer is likely
prospect. To that end,
1)Compute prior probabilities for the Prospect Yes/No
2) Compute the conditional probabilities
   P(age-group=youth|prospect=yes) and
   P(age-group=youth|prospect=no)
where age-group is a predictor variable.
Compute the conditional probabilities for each predictor variable,
namely,(age_group,networth,status,credit_rating)
3) Assuming the assumptions of Naive Bayes are met, compute the posterior probability
P(prospect|X) where X is one of the predictor variable.

Recommendation: Do this by hand and submit name=value format
where name 

Prior Priorities P(prospect=yes),
Prior Priorities P(prospect=no),

Conditional Probabilities:
P(age-group=youth|prospect=yes),
P(age-group=middle|prospect=yes),
P(age-group=senior|prospect=yes),
P(age-group=youth|prospect=no),
P(age-group=middle|prospect=no),
P(age-group=senior|prospect=no),
P(networth=high|prospect=yes),
P(networth=low|prospect=yes),
P(networth=medium|prospect=yes),
P(networth=high|prospect=no),
P(networth=low|prospect=no),
P(networth=medium|prospect=no),
P(status=employed|prospect=yes),
P(status=employed|prospect=no),

P(status=unemployed|prospect=no),
P(credit=fair|prospect=yes),
P(credit=excellent|prospect=no),
P(credit=fair|prospect=yes),
P(credit=excellent|prospect=no)

Posterior Probabilities such as
	  P(prospect=no|age-group,networth,status,credit)
	  P(prospect=yes|age-group,networth,status,credit)
