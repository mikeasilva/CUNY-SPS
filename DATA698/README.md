Mike Silva's Masters in Data Science Course Work for [DATA 698 - Master's Capstone](https://github.com/mikeasilva/CUNY-SPS/tree/master/DATA698).

This course is the culmination of the Master's program.  For this project I created an object detector that could identify poison ivy.  You can learn about the project by watching this short [video introduction](https://www.youtube.com/embed/QFFNxpZYyGI).  For more details I would recommend reading the [paper](https://github.com/mikeasilva/CUNY-SPS/raw/master/DATA698/Using%20ML%20to%20Identify%20Poison%20Ivy%20from%20Look-alikes.pdf).  A complete description of the source code can be found in the appendix.
