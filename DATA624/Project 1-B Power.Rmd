## Directions

Part B consists of a simple dataset of residential power usage for January 1998 until December 2013.  Your assignment is to model these data and a monthly forecast for 2014.  The data is given in a single file.  The variable ‘KWH’ is power consumption in Kilowatt hours, the rest is straight forward.    Add this to your existing files above.
