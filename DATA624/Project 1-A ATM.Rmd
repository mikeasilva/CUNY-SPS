## Directions

In part A, I want you to forecast how much cash is taken out of 4 different ATM machines for May 2010.  The data is given in a single file.  The variable ‘Cash’ is provided in hundreds of dollars, other than that it is straight forward.   I am being somewhat ambiguous on purpose to make this have a little more business feeling.  Explain and demonstrate your process, techniques used and not used, and your actual forecast.  I am giving you data via an excel file, please provide your written report on your findings, visuals, discussion and your R code via an RPubs link along with the actual.rmd file  Also please submit the forecast which you will put in an Excel readable file.
