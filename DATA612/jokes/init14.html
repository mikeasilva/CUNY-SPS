<!--begin of joke -->
The father was very anxious to marry off his only daughter so he wanted 
to impress her date. "Do  you like to screw," he says. "Huh" replied the 
surprised first date. "My daughter she loves to screw and she's good at it, 
you and her  should go screw," carefully explained the father. Now very 
interested the boy replied, "Yes, sir." Minutes later the girl came down 
the stairs, kissed her father goodbye and the couple left. After only a 
few minutes she reappeared, furious, dress torn, hair a mess and screamed
"Dammit, Daddy, it's the TWIST, get it straight!"
