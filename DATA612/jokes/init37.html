<!--begin of joke -->
A Jewish young man was seeing a psychiatrist for an eating and
sleeping disorder. <BR><BR>

"I am so obsessed with my mother... As soon as I go to sleep, I start
dreaming, and everyone in my dream turns into my mother. I wake up in
such a state, all I can do is go downstairs and eat a piece of toast."
<BR><BR>
The psychiatrist replies:
<BR><BR>
"What, just one piece of toast, for a big boy like you?"
