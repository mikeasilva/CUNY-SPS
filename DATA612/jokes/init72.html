On the first day of college, the Dean addressed the students,
pointing out some of the rules:

"The female dormitory will be out-of-bounds for all male students
and the male dormitory to the female students. Anybody caught breaking
this rule will be finded $20 the first time." He continued, "Anybody 
caught breaking this rule the second time will be fined $60. Being caught
a third time will cost you a fine of $180. Are there any questions ?"
<p>
At this point, a male student in the crowd inquired:
<i>"How much for a season pass ?"</i>
