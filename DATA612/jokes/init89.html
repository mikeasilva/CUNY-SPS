<i>A radio conversation of a US naval 
ship with Canadian authorities ... </i>
<p>
Americans: Please divert your course 15 degrees to the North to avoid a
collision.
<p>
Canadians: Recommend you divert YOUR course 15 degrees to the South to 
avoid a collision.
<p>
Americans: This is the Captain of a US Navy ship.  I say again, divert 
YOUR course.
<p>
Canadians: No.  I say again, you divert YOUR course.
<p>
Americans: This is the aircraft carrier USS LINCOLN, the second largest ship in the United States' Atlantic Fleet. We are accompanied by three destroyers, three cruisers and numerous support vessels. I demand that you change your course 15 degrees north, that's ONE FIVE DEGREES NORTH, or counter-measures will be undertaken to ensure the safety of this ship.
<p>
Canadians: <i>This is a lighthouse.  Your call</i>.
