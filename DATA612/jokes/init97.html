A teacher is explaining to her class how different languages use 
negatives differently.  She says, "In all languages, a positive followed
by a negative or a negative followed by a positive makes a negative.  In
some languages, two negatives together make a positive, while in others they
make a negative.  But in no language do two positives make a negative."

One of the students puts up his hand and says, <i>"Yeah, right."</i>
