<!--begin of joke -->
A group of  managers were given the assignment to measure the
height of a flagpole. So they go out to the flagpole with ladders
and tape measures, and they're falling off the ladders, dropping
the tape measures - the whole thing is just a mess.
An engineer comes along and sees what they're trying to do,
walks over, pulls the flagpole out of the ground, lays it flat,
measures it from end to end, gives the measurement to one of the
managers and walks away.
<p>After the engineer has gone, one manager turns to another and
laughs. "Isn't that just like an engineer, we're looking for the 
height and he gives us the length."
