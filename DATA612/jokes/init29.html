<!--begin of joke -->
An old Scotsmen is sitting with a younger Scottish gentleman and says the boy. 
"Ah, lad look out that window. You see that stone wall there, I built it with
me own bare hands, placed every stone meself.  But do they call me MacGregor the
wall builder? No! <P>

He Takes a few sips of his beer then says, "Aye, and look out on that lake and 
eye that beautiful pier. I built it meself, laid every board and hammered each
nail but do they call me MacGregor the pier builder? No! <P>

He continues..."And lad, you see that road? That too I build with me own bare 
hands. Laid every inch of pavement meself, but do they call MacGregor the road
builder? No!"

Again he returns to his beer for a few sips, then says, 
"Agh, but you screw one sheep..."
