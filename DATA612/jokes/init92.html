<!--begin of joke -->
Early one morning a mother went to her sleeping son and woke him up.
<p>
"Wake up, son.  It's time to go to school."<br> 
"But why, Mama?  I don't want to go to school." <br>
"Give me two reasons why you don't want to go to school." <br>
"One, all the children hate me. Two, all the teachers hate me," <br>
"Oh! that's no reason. Come on, you have to go to school," <br>
<p>
"Give me two good reasons WHY I should go to school?" 
<p> 
"One, you are <i>fifty-two</i> years old. Two, you are the <i>principal</i> of the
 school."
