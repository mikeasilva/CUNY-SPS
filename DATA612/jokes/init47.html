<!--begin of joke -->
There was an engineer who had an exceptional gift for fixing all 
things mechanical.  After serving his company loyally for over 30 
years, he happily retired.  Several years later the company contacted 
him regarding a seemingly impossible problem they were having with 
one of their multi-million dollar machines. They had tried everything and 
everyone else to get the machine fixed, but to no avail.  In 
desperation, they called on the retired engineer who had solved so 
many of their problems in the past.
<p>The engineer reluctantly took the challenge.  He spent a day studying 
the huge machine.  At the end of the day, he marked a small "x" in 
chalk on a particular component of the machine and proudly stated, 
<p>"This is where your problem is".
<p>The part was replaced and the machine worked perfectly again. The 
company received a bill for $50,000 from the engineer for his 
service.They demanded an itemized accounting of his charges. The 
engineer responded briefly:
<p>One chalk mark                       $1 
<p>Knowing where to put it            $49,999
<p>It was paid in full and the engineer retired again in peace.
