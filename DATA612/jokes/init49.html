<!--begin of joke -->
Three engineering students were gathered together discussing the
possible designers of the human body.  
<p>One said, "It was a mechanical engineer. Just look at all the joints."  
<p>Another said, "No, it was an electrical engineer.  The nervous systems many thousands of electrical
connections."  
<p>The last said, "Actually it was a civil engineer. Who else would run a toxic waste pipeline through a recreational area?"
