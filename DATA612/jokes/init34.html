<!--begin of joke -->
Out in the backwoods of some midwestern state, little Johnny arrives
at school an hour late.
<P>
Teacher: "Why are you so late, John?"<BR>
Johny : "My big brother got shot in the ass."<BR>
(the teacher corrects his speech)<BR>
Teacher: "Rectum."<BR>
Johnny : "Wrecked him!? Hell, It damn near killed him!"
