Reaching the end of a job interview, the human resources person asked a
young engineer fresh out of Stanford,
<p>
"And what starting salary were you looking for?"
<p>
The engineer said, "In the neighborhood of $125,000 a year, depending
on the benefits package."
<p>
The interviewer said, "Well, what would you say to a package of 5-weeks 
vacation, 14 paid holidays, full medical and dental, company matching 
retirement fund to 50% of salary, and a company car leased every 2 years - 
say, a red Corvette?"
<p>
The Engineer sat up straight and said, "Wow! Are you <i>kidding</i>?"
<p>
And the interviewer replied, <i>"Yeah, but you started it."</i>
