<!--begin of joke -->
A guy stood over his tee shot for what seemed an eternity, looking up, looking down, measuring the distance,
figuring the wind direction and speed. Driving his partner nuts.
<P>
Finally his exasperated partner says, "What the hell is taking so long? Hit the goddamn ball!"
The guy answers, "My wife is up there watching me from the clubhouse. I want to make this a perfect shot."
"Well, hell, man, you don't stand a snowball's chance in hell of hitting her from here!"
