<!--begin of joke -->
A mechanical, electrical and a software engineer from Microsoft were
driving through the desert when the car broke down. The mechanical
engineer said "It seems to be a problem with the fuel injection system,
why don't we pop the hood and I'll take a look at it." To which the
electrical engineer replied, "No I think it's just a loose ground wire,
I'll get out and take a look." Then, the Microsoft engineer jumps in.
"No, no, no. If we just close up all the windows, get out, wait a few
minutes, get back in, and then reopen the windows everything will work
fine."
