<!--begin of joke -->
An explorer in the deepest Amazon suddenly finds himself surrounded
by a bloodthirsty group of natives. Upon surveying the situation, he
says quietly to himself, "Oh God, I'm screwed." 
<P>
The sky darkens and a voice booms out, "No, you are NOT
screwed. Pick up that stone at your feet and bash in the head of the
chief standing in front of you." 
<P>
So with the stone he bashes the life out of the chief. Standing above
the lifeless body, breathing heavily looking at 100 angry natives... 
<P>
The voice booms out again, "Okay ..... NOW you're screwed."
