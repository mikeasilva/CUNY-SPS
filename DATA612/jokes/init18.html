A dog walks into Western Union and asks the clerk to send a telegram. He fills out a form on which he
writes down the telegram he wishes to send: "Bow wow wow, Bow wow wow."
<P>
The clerk says, "You can add another 'Bow wow' for the same price."
<P>
The dog responded, "Now wouldn't that sound a little silly?"
