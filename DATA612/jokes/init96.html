Two attorneys went into a diner and ordered two drinks.  Then they produced 
sandwiches from their briefcases and started to eat.  The owner became
quite concerned and marched over and told them, <i>"You can't eat your own
sandwiches in here!"</i>
<p>
The attorneys looked at each other, shrugged their shoulders and then
<i>exchanged</i> sandwiches.
