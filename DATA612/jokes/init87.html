A man, recently completing a routine physical examination receives a
phone call from his doctor.  The doctor says, "I have some good news and
some bad news."  The man says, "OK, give me the good news first."  The
doctor says, "The good news is, you have 24 hours to live."  The man
replies, "Shit!  That's the good news?  Then what's the bad news?"
<p>
The doctor says, "The bad news is, I forgot to call you <i>yesterday</i>."
