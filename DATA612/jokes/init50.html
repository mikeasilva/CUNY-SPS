<!--begin of joke -->
A guy goes into confession and says to the priest, "Father, I'm 80 years
old, widower, with 11 grandchildren. Last night I met two beautiful flight
attendants. They took me home and I made love to both of them. Twice."
<P>
The priest said: "Well, my son, when was the last time you were in
confession?"
<p> "Never Father, I'm Jewish."
<p> "So then, why are you telling me?"
<p> "I'm telling everybody."
