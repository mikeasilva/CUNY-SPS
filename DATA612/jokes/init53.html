One Sunday morning William burst into the living room and said,
"Dad! Mom! I have some great news for you! I am getting married
to the most beautiful girl in town. She lives a block away and
her name is Susan."
<p>After dinner, William's dad took him aside. "Son, I have to talk
with you. Your mother and I have been married 30 years.. She's a
wonderful wife but she has never offered much excitement in the
bedroom, so I used to fool around with women a lot. Susan is
actually your half-sister, and I'm afraid you can't marry her."
<p>William was heart-broken. After eight months he eventually
started dating girls again. A year later he came home and very
proudly announced, "Dianne said yes! We're getting married in
June."
<p>Again his father insisted on another private conversation and
broke the sad news. "Dianne is your half-sister too, William. I'm
awfully sorry about this."
<p>William was furious! He finally decided to go to his mother with
the news.
<p>"Dad has done so much harm.. I guess I'm never going to get
married,"  he complained. "Every time I fall in love, Dad tells
me the girl is my half-sister."
<p>His mother just shook her head. "Don't pay any attention to what
he says, dear. He's not really your father."
