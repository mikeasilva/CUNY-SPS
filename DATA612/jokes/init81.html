<!--begin of joke -->
An Asian man goes into a New York CityBank to exchange 10,000 yen for
American Currency.  The teller gives him $72.00.  The next month the
Asian man goes into the same bank with 10,000 yen and receives $62.00.
He asks, "How come? Only $62.00?" The teller says "Fluctuations-
Fluctuations!"
<p>
Whereupon the Asian man looks back at the teller and says "<i>Fluk you
Amelicans too<i>!"
