Clinton returns from a vacation in Arkansas and walks down  the
steps of Air Force One with two pigs under his arms.  At the bottom
of the steps, he says  to the honor guardsman, "These are genuine
Arkansas Razor-Back Hogs.  I got this one for Chelsea and this one for
Hillary."  <P>

The guardsman replies, "Nice trade, Sir."
