<!--begin of joke -->
There once was a man and a woman that both  got in  a terrible car wreck. Both of their vehicles  
were completely destroyed, buy fortunately, no one  was   hurt.  In thankfulness, the woman said to the 
man, 'We are both okay, so we should celebrate. I have   a  bottle of wine in my car, let's open it.'         
So the woman got the bottleout of the car, and  handed it to the man. The man took a really big drink, 
and handed the woman the bottle. The  woman  closed the bottle and put it down. The man  asked,  
'Aren't you going to take a drink?' 
<p>
The woman cleverly replied, 
<i>'No, I think I'll  just  wait for the cops to get here.'</i>
