<!--begin of joke -->
A guy walks into a bar, orders a beer and says to the bartender,
"Hey, I got this great Polish Joke..." 
<P>
The barkeep glares at him and says in a warning tone of voice:
"Before you go telling that joke you better know that I'm Polish, both
bouncers are Polish and so are most of my customers"
<P>
"Okay" says the customer,"I'll tell it very slowly."
