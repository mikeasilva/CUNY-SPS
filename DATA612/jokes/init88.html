<!--begin of joke -->
A Czechoslovakian man felt his eyesight was growing steadily worse, and 
felt it was time to go see an optometrist. 
<p>
The doctor started with some simple testing, and showed him a standard eye 
chart with letters of
diminishing size: CRKBNWXSKZY. . . 
<p>
"Can you read this?" the doctor asked. 
<p>
"Read it?" the Czech answered. <i>"Doc, I know him!"</i>
