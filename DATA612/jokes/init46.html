<!--begin of joke -->
<p>A couple has been married for 75 years. For the husband's 95th
birthday, his wife decides to surprise him by hiring a prostitute.
That day, the doorbell rings. The husband uses his walker to get to
the door and opens it. 
<p>A 21-year-old in a latex outfit smiles and
says, "Hi, I here to give you super sex!" 
<p>The old man says, "I'll take the soup."
