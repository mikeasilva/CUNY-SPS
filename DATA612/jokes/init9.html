<!--begin of joke -->
A country guy goes into a city bar that has a dress code, and the maitre
d' 
demands he wear a tie. Discouraged, the guy goes to his car to sulk when 
inspiration strikes: He's got jumper cables in the trunk! So he wraps
them around his neck, sort of like a string tie (a bulky string tie to be
sure) and returns to the bar. The maitre d' is reluctant, but says to the
guy, "Okay, you're a pretty resourceful fellow, you can come in... but
just don't start anything"!
