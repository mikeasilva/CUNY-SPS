<p>During a recent publicity outing, Hillary sneaked off to visit a
fortune teller of some local repute.  In a dark and hazy room, peering
into a crystal ball, the mystic delivered grave news.
<p>"There's no easy way to say this, so I'll just be blunt: Prepare
yourself to be a widow.  Your husband will die a violent and horrible
death this year."
<p>Visibly shaken, Hillary stared at the woman's lined face, then at 
the single flickering candle, then down at her hands.  She took a few 
deep breaths to compose herself.  She simply had to know.  She met the
fortune teller's gaze, steadied her voice, and asked her question.
<p>"Will I be acquitted?"
