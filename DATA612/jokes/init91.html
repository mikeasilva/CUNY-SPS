<!--begin of joke -->
A Panda bear walks into a bar.  Sits down at a table and orders a beer 
and a double cheeseburger.  After he is finished eating, he pulls out a gun
and rips the place with gunfire.  Patrons scatter and dive under chairs and
tables as the bear runs out the door.  After ensuring that no one is hurt, 
the bartender races out the door, and calls after the bear "What the hell did
you do that for?"  The bear calls back, "I'm a Panda bear.  Look it up in the
dictionary."

The bartender returns, pulls out his dictionary.
