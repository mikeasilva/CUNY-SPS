Two men are discussing the age old question: who enjoys sex more, the
man or the woman?  A woman walks by and listens in for awhile and then
interrupts: 
<p>"Listen you guys. You know when your ear itches and you put in your 
little finger and wiggle it around for awhile?  Afterward,
which feels better, your finger or your ear?"
