<!--begin of joke -->
At a recent Sacramento PC Users Group meeting,
a company was demonstrating its latest speech-
recognition software.   A representative from the
company was just about ready to start the
demonstration and asked everyone in the room
to quiet down.
<p>
Just then someone in the back of the room yelled,
<i>"Format C: Return."</i>
<p>
Someone else chimed in:
<i>"Yes, Return"</i>
<p>
Unfortunately, the software worked.
