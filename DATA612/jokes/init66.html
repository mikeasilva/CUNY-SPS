<!--begin of joke -->
A lawyer opened the door of his BMW, when suddenly a car came along
and hit the door, ripping it off completely.  When the police arrived
at the scene, the lawyer was complaining bitterly about the damage to
his precious BMW.  
<p>"Officer, look what they've done to my Beeeeemer!!!", he whined.  
<p>"You lawyers are so materialistic, you make
me sick!!!"  retorted the officer.  "You're so worried about your
stupid BMW, that you didn't even notice that your left arm was ripped
off!!!"  
<p>"Oh my gaaaad...", replied the lawyer, finally noticing the
bloody left shoulder where his arm once was.  "Where's my
Rolex???!!!!"
