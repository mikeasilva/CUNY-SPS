Bill & Hillary are on a trip back to Arkansas. They're almost out of gas, so Bill pulls into a service station on the outskirts of
town. The attendant runs out of the station to serve them when Hillary realizes it's an old boyfriend from high school. She and
the attendant chat as he gases up their car and cleans the windows. Then they all say good-bye. 
<P>
As Bill pulls the car onto the road, he turns to Hillary and says, 'Now aren't you glad you married me and not him ? You could've
been the wife of a grease monkey !' 
<P>
To which Hillary replied, 'No, Bill. If I would have married him, you'd be pumping gas and he would be the President !'
