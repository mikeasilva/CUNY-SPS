<!--begin of joke -->
An engineer, a physicist and a mathematician are sleeping in a
room. There is a fire in the room. The engineer wakes up, sees the fire,
picks up the bucket of water and douses the fire and goes back to
sleep. 
<P>
Again there is fire in the room. This time, the physicist wakes
up, notices the bucket, fills it with water, calculates the optimal
trajectory and douses the fire in minimum amount of water and goes
back to sleep. 
<P>
Again there is fire. This time the mathematician wakes up. 
He looks at the fire, looks at the bucket and the water and
exclaims, "A solution exists" and goes back to sleep.
