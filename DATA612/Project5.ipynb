    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this project is give you practice beginning to work with a distributed\n",
    "recommender system.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is sufficient for this assignment to build out your application on a single node.\n",
    "\n",
    "Adapt one of your recommendation systems to work with Apache Spark and compare the performance with your previous iteration. Consider the efficiency of the system\n",
    "and the added complexity of using Spark. You may complete the assignment using PySpark (Python), SparkR (R) , sparklyr (R), or Scala.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please include in your conclusion: For your given recommender systemâ€™s data, algorithm(s), and (envisioned) implementation, at what point would you see moving to a\n",
    "distributed platform such as Spark becoming necessary?\n",
    "\n",
    "You may work on any platform of your choosing, including Databricks Community Edition or in local mode. You are encouraged but not required to work in a small group on this\n",
